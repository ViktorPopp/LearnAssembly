# Installation
This tutorial is Linux only and is not compatible with Windows. I recommend using either Windows Subsystems for Linux or Cygwin. The following programs are needed for this tutorial:

### nasm (assembler)
`nasm`, short for Netwide Assembler, is an assembler for the x86 CPU architecture. It converts assembly language code into machine code. It's widely used for its simplicity and ability to generate output in various file formats, including flat binaries, COFF, ELF, and more.
* **Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint:** `sudo apt install nasm`
* **RHEL, Fedora, AlmaLinux:** `sudo dnf install nasm`
* **Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS:** `sudo pacman -S nasm`

### ld (linker)
`ld` is the GNU linker, which is part of the GNU Binutils package. The linker combines multiple object files generated by the assembler into a single executable or library. It resolves references to undefined symbols, assigns final addresses to procedures and variables, and determines the memory layout of the resulting binary.
* **Debian-based distributions:** `sudo apt-get install binutils`
* **RPM-based distributions:** `sudo yum install binutils`

### hexdump (hex viewer)
`hexdump` is a command-line utility that displays binary files in hexadecimal, decimal, octal, or ASCII format. It's particularly useful for examining the contents of binary files, debugging, and reverse engineering. For example, hexdump -C file will show the file content in a readable hexadecimal and ASCII format.
* **Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint:** `sudo apt install hexdump`
* **RHEL, Fedora, AlmaLinux:** `sudo dnf install hexdump`
* **Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS:** `sudo pacman -S hexdump`

### objdump (object file dumper)
`objdump` is a command-line program for displaying various information about object files on Unix-like operating systems. It can be used as a disassembler to view an executable in assembly form. It is part of the GNU Binutils for fine-grained control over executables and other binary data. objdump allows you to analyze and manipulate object files, examine their contents, and debug applications.
* **Debian-based distributions:** `sudo apt-get install binutils`
* **RPM-based distributions:** `sudo yum install binutils`

### gcc (GNU Compiler Collection)
`gcc` is a compiler suite that includes front-ends for C, C++, Objective-C, Fortran, Ada, Go, and Java, as well as libraries and development tools (like binutils and gdb). GCC is widely used for developing software on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD.
* **Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint:** `sudo apt install gcc`
* **RHEL, Fedora, AlmaLinux:** `sudo dnf install gcc`
* **Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS:** `sudo pacman -S gcc`
